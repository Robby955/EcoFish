# EcoFish
Code Used for analysis of Data and visulizations of Environmental DNA measurements taken from ecofish datasets.

Three main set of codes will be avaliable.

The first set of code is an analysis of a density related experiment.
The second set of code is the analysis of a dilution related experiment.
Finally, we include a code for the testing and outlier search for several eDNA related primers.


# Density Experiment 
The goal was to investigate the relationship between
Transformed CT values ('TCT') and coho salmon 'density' (or the similar measurement
of biomass). CT is the Cycle Threshold and we defne TCT=50-CT. The
experiment consisted of manipulating juvenile coho salmon densities in treatments of
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 65 fish in replicated 10,000L tanks.

# Dilution Experiment

In this experiment, three juvenile coho were allowed to acclimate to four tanks (tanks 19, 20, 21 and 24) and were subsequently removed.After the coho were removed, water was allowed to flow out of each tank at a known
rate as it was replaced, or diluted, by hatchery water. Measurements were obtained at several intervals of varying levels of flow. Moreover, several control samples were taken from the hatchery kitchen sink and from the hatchery pond.


# Field Study

- to add


# Distribution Checks

Analysis of several eDNA related qPCR targets. Checking for consistency and outliers under several distributions.
