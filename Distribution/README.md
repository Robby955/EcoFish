This folder contains the code to run the distribution check data. This data was not included in the thesis. To run this code, you need
the LOD/LOQ (Helbing-LOD_LOQ_DataZero48-040319MJAML.csv) data in your working directory.

run_distribution1 produces the main tests, where we fit the observed LOD/LOQ data agaisnt several distributions.
