\section{Residual Analysis}

We now consider the residuals for some of the models we previously fit. To create the residual plot for l.tankregression we used the `broom' package \citep{broom}.

Figure~\ref{lab:resid2} shows the residuals from three of the models we fit. The residuals appear to be randomly distributed about the x-axis which is a good indication that our model is making valid assumptions. Figure~\ref{lab:resid22} is a plot of the residuals for l.tankregression. The residuals again appear to be randomly distributed about the x-axis. Although Tank 21 has consistently negative residuals. The legend indicates which tank each point belonged to.
