ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\end{center}



I would like to thank my advisor, Mary Lesperance for all her support and assistance. I would also like to thank the team at EcoFish Research, especially Morgan Hocking and Jeff MacAdams. As well, thank you to the team at Caren Helbing's lab, including Michael Allison and Lauren Bergman. Finally, I would like to acknowledge and thank my mother as I would not have had the opportunity to further my education without her support.

I also acknowledge the Lekwungen peoples on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.
