This contains a pdf version of my final thesis. It also contains the latex files that are used to create the thesis. To create the thesis, you need the image files and all the latex files. Alternatively, you can render most of the files by running the R codes. The plots and saving the plot is commented out in the code, so you would need to remove the comment section and save the plot to the correct chapter.

This folder alone recreates the thesis. You create the file using the mainthesisUVIC.tex document. You need the image chapters saved in the same folder along with the frontmatter.

To recreate the thesis, you will need to have Latex installed and the correct packages updated.
