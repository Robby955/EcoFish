This contains a pdf version of my final thesis. It also contains the latex files that are used to create the thesis. To create the thesis, you need the image files and all the latex files. Alternatively, you can render most of the files by running the R codes. The plots and saving the plot is commented out in the code, so you would need to remove the comment section and save the plot to the correct chapter.
